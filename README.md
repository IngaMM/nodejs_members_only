Discussion
I used the following technologies: HTML, Javascript & Express (Nodejs).

This app is an exclusive clubhouse where members can write posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.
The app uses authentication with passport. When users sign up, they are not automatically given membership status! They need to enter a secret passcode (jointheclub) correctly in order to become members. Only admins (admin status given at sign up) can delete messages.

A live version of this app can be found at https://mighty-dusk-67107.herokuapp.com

Requirements
